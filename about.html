        <p class="aboutpara"> I love to read, hike, cook/bake, workout and especially <strong>learn</strong>!
        I just recently got into coding. Got a membership on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and started doing some of their courses!
        I started out on the Learn Python 3 course for beginners. Got about half way through and decided to change it up a bit.
        Something that probably isn't recommended. But I focused on HTML and CSS for about a month.
        I was absolutely hooked! That was when I started researching the best way to get a job in the industry.
        Which is what eventually lead me to Springboard! I am super excited to change my career from common factory worker, to something that better fits me!
        With a background in the medical field, I have a soft spot for the word of Medicine. I will settle for nothing less then a career in the Biotech Industry.
        Hopefully I can make it there before it takes off to much. That being said that is my ultimate goal and believe that completing the Software Engineering course at Springboard is a valid step towards that goal.
        Aside from that I like to spend time with family and my childhood, when I visit said family. Bub and Purr-C are their names. They are two of the oddest cats I have ever had the pleasure to meet.
        As you can see below Bub is both festive and a bit on the chunky side.
        Purr-C on the other hand is a dubious little creature that likes to get up to mischief.
        Anyway, not much else to tell. I am not a very exciting person but I hope to change that through a new career!
